Ave
===

Ave is a programming language based on functional combinators.

Like concatenative languages, Ave tries to simplify syntax by having function
composition (instead of application) as the basic language construct. That 
means that in Ave everything is a function made of other functions,
allowing to create program without variables (as to reduce state)
in a point-free style.

== Roadmap.

Ave is on its very early days.

Each Ave release will have a bird name in the spirit of those found on the book: 
[To Mock a Mockingbird and Other Logic Puzzles: Including an Amazing Adventure
on Combinatory Logic | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Mock_a_Mockingbird]

The first prototype is codenamed Krazy Kiwi, being implemented in Ruby and
targeting the Rubinius VM.


== Mocking birds.

Ave (Bird in spanish) is inspired on an article on functional
combinators: http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/
